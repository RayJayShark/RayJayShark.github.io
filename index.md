# Self-Assessment

Throughout my work in the Computer Science curriculum at Southern New Hampshire University I have gained many skills in software development. It has given me experience in many areas, including full-stack development, object-oriented programming, and database management. Through this, I have been able to create and maintain goals and ideas for my future career path. One of the most important concepts I was introduced to was team-based programming. This course gave me the experience to work effectively in a team environment using git repositories. I have also been introduced to communicating with stakeholders effectively. This is important as this communication is the foundation for what I will be developing in my future position. Specifically, through this portfolio, I have gained more insight into the concepts of software engineering, data structures and algorithms, and database management. 

When looking at the following enhancements of my Poker Bot project, you will see that I have leveraged the object-oriented structure with services to allow for effective logging. Services are a helpful tool in giving the project access to the necessary methods and logic in an efficient manner. I also utilized logging templates that gives control over how a log is created and output. The logs are each given a specific level that gives the user further control in the amount of information they would like to receive from the program. I also created a service for access and manipulating the database as an enhancement. This gives efficient persistence through C#â€™s async and await operators and a MySQL database, allowing the players to record and share their game statistics. I was also able to implement a library to aid in database access. In the last enhancement to the project, I created an efficient algorithm for scoring and comparing the poker hands. The implementation of the scoring also utilizes asynchronous programming to find the possible combinations of cards for each player, find the score of each hand, and compare the scores to find the winning hand. The asynchronous nature of the algorithm allows the complex scoring to happen almost instantaneously for the players to allow for a smooth user experience. These enhancements fit together to display the skills and knowledge I have gained throughout by college career.

# Poker Bot

Poker Bot is a bot I created to use with Discord. This bot allows users to play Texas Hold 'Em through text commands in Discord.

## Code Review

The pre-enhancement source code can be found on the pre-enhancement branch of the git repository <a href="https://github.com/RayJayShark/PokerBot/tree/pre-enhancement" target="_blank">here</a>.

## Enhancements
There were three enhancments made to this project, one for each of the following categories:

- [Software Design and Engineering](design.md)
- [Algorithms and Data Structures](algorithms.md)
- [Databases](databases.md)

Each of the categories in the list above is a link to more details about the enhancement, including examples, narratives, and links to the source code of the project.
